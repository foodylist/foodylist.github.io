			"contents": "In order to properly evaluate a deal, it is important to review the parties concerns and risks. Here, GM wanted to give Cerebus Group majority control of GMAC because it can no longer properly manage given the financial difficult and debt both GM and GMAC were facing. I am assuming that since GM is only giving 51% and retaining an option to buy back GMAC, they wanted a buyer who would temporarily manage GMAC and assist in make it financially stable. Cerebus fits the bill because private equity funds are known for short-term investments (normally 10 year) and exits in the form of IPOs or sale. Cerebus’s primary concern is providing returns to their investors. Cerebus, in purchasing majority stake of GMACC, wants to make sure that they have full control of the company in order to make necessary decisions and that they company’s condition is no worse than presented. \nGM will want to make sure that Cerebus brings to the table what it promised: liquidity and ability to manage the GMAC’s financial woes. The purchase price of $14 billion addresses the concern. It provides some returns to GM in the form of assets and dividend and cash. Furthermore, the $25 billion credit facility provides some assurance that Cerebus will help lessen GMAC’s debt. It also keeps in mind Cerebus’s concerns that GM remain invested in the company—by requiring them to reinvest 10% of the purchase price into nonvoting shares. \nThe primary concern among the parties is uncertainty. Cerebus wants to make sure that they have control over GMAC and that GM, although monitoring as a minority owner, not hinder decisions. GM, given their long-term plans, are concerned about moral hazard and want to make sure that Cerebus doesn’t make decisions that are too risky.  \nThe terms of the deal give Cerebus 51% of GMAC’s voting and equity. The governance provisions also provide some aid to this issue. By giving Cerebus the right to pick the CEO and CFO and giving them 6/13 directors on the board, Cerebus feels satisfied that GM will not hinder their decision-making. GM is also satisfied because Cerebus does not majority control on the board. The addition of 3 independent directors protects against self-interested, risky decisions. I think this provides an equitable solution to the problem because it addresses concerns of both parties without giving any one party majority control of the board. \nAnother aspect of this uncertainty is GM’s concern as to exactly how Cerebus will manage the company. Cerebus essentially has a $14 billion dollar option in the company. We are not informed as to how much the company is worth but I imagine it is more. It is possible that Cerebus will prevent GMAC from financing GM vehicles or change the conduct of business. GM is concerned about this because it will remain a minority shareholder and would have reinvested some of the purchase price. The exclusivity contract addresses this concern because it makes sure that GMAC will continue providing vehicle financing to GM customers in accordance with historical practices. I, however, do not believe this was an adequate response. The deal has no provision as to what GMAC cannot do. It can enter into a different arena of financing or take extremely risky business conduct. Private equity companies depend highly on their reputation in the market and thus, this would prevent them from making extreme decisions. But the deal should have had some provision addressing any such conduct. It is possible that GM wanted such a provision but Cerebus did not want to be too constrained in their ability to make returns on the investment.  \nThe deal also gives GM a 10-year option to repurchase the GMAC auto financing operations at their fair market value. GM will want to preserve the value of this by preventing Cerebus from making risky decisions that affect the long-term value of the company. Cerebus, on the other hand, will want to make riskier decisions because as a private equity firm, by nature, they want to make returns in the short term.  ",

			"contents": "there are some interesting points in the forrester report.  one important one is the vendor is more worried about giving confessions than you are about getting them since they don't want this to set a precedent for other customers.  \n\ni'm going to put some points inline and you will have to expand on them.  sorry i couldn't have more time on this.  \n\non wed, dec 10, 2014 at 12:02 pm, nikolai chowdhury <nikolai.ishan@gmail.com> wrote:\nso this is forrester's white paper\nand i also attached a sample final paper from last year\n\nbasically i want to write a 10-12 page whitepaper on tactics for dealing with the negotiation with a software/offshore company\n\nintro: ​assumption that you are looking for a technical partner in the areas of software development and / or management of infrastructure and / or bpo\n \n​\nkey metrics to look for in a partner:​  ​\n\n​technical acumen of leaders and team members, experience in deployment of such services for other customers, process that is used to deliver these services - agile, waterfall, hybrid.  \ncommunication acumen of the same.  it is important to differentiate between the negotiators and the people who will be performing the services. in many cases the onshore counterparts are better trained, us schooled, high caliber folks, the recruits offshore while technically competant on paper may lack crucial interaction skills.  this is not to be taken as a generalization or stereotyping, it is real and based on experience.  ​\nwhat to watch out for:\n​deliverables are hard to quantize - are you engaging them to complete some work or for ongoing operations. slas will need to be established.  difficulty is how does one judge if a task should take 2 days or 2 weeks while the work is yet to be defined.  the best and only rule of thumb is to hire great people and ensure there is a solid process for onboarding them and a process for doing the work. this means that the standards you apply to your local employees have to be applied to the offshore vendor.  you need to be a part of the hiring / onboarding process - and you will get push back on this.  the trick will be to agree on this in terms of if i am hiring your people as i would my people then we will be on the same page in the execution phase.  \n\nwatch out for contract terms, renewals, overtime, holiday schedules in other countries, timezone timings.  btw - i am not a fan of graveyard shifts, it leads to inefficiencies and tired staff. do not be fooled by this notion of 24 hour coverage via follow the sun - this does not work. ​ \nnegotiaiton process:\n​pricing is of course important, replacement of staff that doesn't fit is equally important, in the case of operations management there have to be make-good terms in the slas.  reporting is important not reams of documentation which the cmmi-level-5 firms tend to do but moreover insist on dashboards and alerts.  establish kpm or key metrics, such as # of calls closed successfully, projects completed on time and under budget, # pointf of effort in agile sprints, be a part of the employee review process. ​\nwhat to compete on, what to ask for:\n​it is important to visit the offshore site and this has to be figured into the cost model, travel room & board etc. also important to have their key members visit your offices.  these are overlooked yet very key items for success. this builds trust and camarederie.  (sp) also important while the negotiations are happening to make sure your own team is on board - - would suggest this happens before you bring in the vendors or decide on the outsourcing strategy.  the team dynamic is a big topic and there is lots of ground to cover here.  ​\n\nthey have to provide you with tech leadership * every activity that they are doing with you cannot be a bilibale activity, we want them to come back to us and say that if you move to the cloud youll save money and scale -- waht you dont want is to be in a vendor relationship where you are going into a restaruant, and they give you what you ask for thenyou dont really want that kind of relationship; partners as if they think of themselves as they think of you .\n\nthat is waht you are looking for -- negotiation is getting to the esssece of how smart are these guys what are the senior people doing, and that is the key here. \n\n\nnegotiatoion is on quality and technology leadership. \nthat metric in and of it self will make your endavor succeed or fail\n\nnext we have to presell to our own organization on why you are outsourcing and you have to deal with taht up front -- or they will be like AHH im going to lose my job\n\npreselling to the orgnaiation why theya re doin this\n\nstart out in some areas, outsourcing operational stuff and keeping the knowledge work within the company still want to pick a vendor who can grow into a technology leadership and technology role, startup in an operational role -- then can grow into that.\n\ntactic --> they have the potentail. determination whether something succeeds or fails. \n\n\nCONTEXT & BACKGROUND………………….…………………….\nKEY METRICS………………………………………….\nPITFALLS……………………………………………..\nORGANIZATIONAL ADVICE……………………………………………..\nCONCLUSION……………………………………\nCONCLUSION……………………………………\n",
